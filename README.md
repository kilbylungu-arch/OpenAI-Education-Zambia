# Open-Source AI & Machine Learning Education Tools for Zambia

## Overview  
This project develops open-source AI and Machine Learning tools to improve education access and quality for children in Zambiaâ€™s underserved and rural communities. Our focus includes adaptive learning, early learning difficulty detection, speech recognition in local languages, and offline content delivery on low-cost devices.

## Features  
- **Adaptive Learning Models:** Personalized lesson pacing and difficulty.  
- **Early Learning Difficulty Detection:** Identify challenges like dyslexia and ADHD.  
- **Speech Recognition & NLP:** Support for Zambian local languages (Bemba, Nyanja, Tonga, Lozi, etc.).  
- **Automated Content Generation:** Curriculum-aligned lesson plans and quizzes.  
- **Offline-First Design:** Runs on Raspberry Pi and Android tablets without internet.
